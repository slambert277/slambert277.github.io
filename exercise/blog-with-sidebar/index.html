                    BBC Studios and The Walt Disney Company today announced the 
                    first-ever animated feature film for Bluey. The film will 
                    premiere in cinemas worldwide in 2027, followed by streaming 
                    on Disney+. The movie will also air on ABC iview and ABC 
                    Kids in Australia post-theatrical release.
                    
                    Written and directed by Bluey creator Joe Brumm, the film 
                    is a Ludo Studio production in collaboration with BBC 
                    Studios. The film will star vocal talent from series, 
                    including Melanie Zanetti and David McCormack, along with 
                    music created by Bluey composer Joff Bush.

                    animation producer Amber Naismith (‘Happy Feet’, ‘The Lego 
                    Movie’, ‘The Lego Batman Movie’) with Richard Jeffery 
                    returning to co-direct (’Bluey’ Series 1-3). Joe Brumm will 
                    serve as executive producer, alongside Charlie Aspinwall and

                    Bluey creator Joe Brumm said:
                    
                    “I really enjoyed the experience of working with a longer 
                    format on ‘The Sign’ in Series 3, so going even further with 
                    a feature film feels like a natural extension of that. I’ve 
                    always thought ‘Bluey’ deserved a theatrical movie. I want 
                    this to be an experiential event for the whole family to 
                    enjoy together. I’m excited to continue to partner with 
                    Cecilia Persson, Tom Fussell and the team at BBC Studios, 
                    and Dana Walden, Alan Bergman and Disney to bring this new 
                    ‘Bluey’ story to the big screen.” Daley Pearson and Charlie 
                    Aspinwall, Co-Founders and Directors, Ludo Studio, said:

                    “Over the past eight years, we’ve had the privilege of 
                    working alongside an extraordinary team of more than fifty 
                    artists and producers whose talent, dedication, and 
                    creativity have shaped ‘Bluey’ into the beloved series it is 
                    today. Their work has paved the way for this incredible 
                    opportunity to expand ‘Bluey’s world onto the big screen. 
                    We’re excited to continue showing Queensland as a home for 
                    world-class talent and to share a new beautiful ‘Bluey’ 
                    story by Joe Brumm with families around the world.”
