            <b>Crown Shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement</i>,
            <sup>[1]</sup> <i>canopy shyness</i>,<sup>[2]</sup>or<i>inter-crown 
            spacing</i><sup>[3]</sup>) is a phenomenon observed in some tree 
            species, in which the crowns of full stocked trees do not touch each 
            other, forming a canopy with change-like gaps.<sup>[4]</sup>
            <sup>[5]</sup>The phenomenon is most prevelent amoung trees of the 
            same species, but also occurs between trees of different species.
            <sup>[6]</sup><sup>[7]</sup>There exist many hypotheses as to why 
            crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that 
            it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

            The exact physiological basisi of crown shyness is not certain.
            <sup>[6]</sup>The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific
            literature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup>The variety of hypotheses
            and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple 
            mechanisms across difference species, and example of convergent 
            evolution.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches 
            leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees: trees in windy 
            areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during
            winds; the abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness response. 
            Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced 
            by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.<sup>[10]</sup>
            If the crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the 
            winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.<sup>[11]</sup>This 
            explains instances of crown shyness between branches of the same 
            organism. Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly 
            seen in conditions conducive to this pruning, including windy 
            forests, stands of flexible trees, and early succession forests 
            where branches are flexible and limited in lateral movement.
            <sup>[6]</sup><sup>[12]</sup>According to this theroy, variable 
            flexibility in lateral branches greatly influences the degree of 
            crown shyness.

            Similarly, some research suggests that constant abrasion at growth 
            nodules disrupts bud tissue such that it is unable to continue with 
            lateral growth. Australian forester M.R. Jacobs, who studied the 
            crown shyness patterns in eucalyptus in 1955, believed that the 
            trees' growing tips were sensitive to abrasion, resulting in canopy 
            gaps.<sup>[13]</sup>Miguel Franco (1986) observed that the branches 
            of Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce) and Larix kaempferi (Japanese 
            larch) suffered physical damage due to abrasion, which killed the 
            leading shoots.<sup>[10]</sup><sup>[14]</sup>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A prominent hypothesis is that canopy shyness has to do with mutual 
            light sensing by adjacent plants. The photoreceptor-mediated shade 
            avoidance response is a well-documented behavior in a variety of 
            plant species.<sup>[15]</sup>Neighbor detection is thought to be a 
            function of several unique photoreceptors. Plants can sense the 
            proximity of neighbors by sensing backscattered far-red light, a 
            task widely thought to be accomplished by the activity of the 
            phytochrome photoreceptors.<sup>[16]</sup>Many species of plant 
            respond to an increase in far-red light (and, by extension, 
            encroaching neighbors) by directing growth away from the far-red 
            stimulus and by increasing the rate of elongation.<sup>[17]</sup> 
            Similarly, plants use blue light to induce the shade-avoidance 
            response, likely playing a role in the recognition of neighboring 
            plants,[18] though this was just starting to be recognised in 1988.
            <sup>[19]</sup>

            The characterization of these behaviors might suggest that crown 
            shyness is simply the result of mutual shading based on 
            well-understood shade avoidance responses.<sup>[6]</sup>
            <sup>[20]</sup>Malaysian scholar Francis S.P. Ng, who studied 
            Dryobalanops aromatica, suggested that the growing tips were 
            sensitive to light levels and stopped growing when nearing the 
            adjacent foliage due to the induced shade.<sup>[6]</sup>

        <p>
            A 2015 study has suggested that Arabidopsis thaliana shows different 
            leaf placement strategies when grown amongst kin and unrelated 
            conspecifics, shading dissimilar neighbors and avoiding kin. This 
            response was shown to be contingent on the proper functioning of 
            multiple photosensory modalities.<sup>[21]</sup>A 1998 study 
            proposed similar systems of photoreceptor-mediated inhibition of 
            growth as explanations of crown shyness,<sup>[6]</sup>
            <sup>[20]</sup>though a causal link between photoreceptors and crown 
            asymmetry had yet to be experimentally proven. This might explain 
            instances of intercrown spacing that are only exhibited between 
            conspecifics.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[7]</sup>
