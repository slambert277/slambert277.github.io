        <h2>Homemade Ketchup<h2>
            Let’s start with the ketchup! Begin by combining tomato paste and 
            water in a medium saucepan. Stir until the paste is fully diluted; 
            this will form the base of your ketchup. Next, add Worcestershire 
            sauce, sugar, vinegar, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, 
            and cinnamon. Whisk everything together until smooth and 
            well-blended. The combination of these spices is what gives ketchup 
            its unique, tangy-sweet flavor.

            Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a 
            simmer. Once it starts to bubble, reduce the heat to low and let it 
            cook for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. This simmering 
            process allows the flavors to meld together beautifully and helps 
            thicken the ketchup. Once it has thickened to your liking, remove 
            the saucepan from the heat and let the ketchup cool. Transfer it to 
            a jar or bottle and pop it in the fridge.

            <b>Tips and Tricks:</b> For a smokier flavor, try adding a dash of 
            smoked paprika or chipotle powder. If you prefer a smoother ketchup, 
            you can blend it once it has cooled down in a food processor or 
            blender. Adjust the sweetness by adding more or less sugar according 
            to your taste. If you like it more acidic, add more vinegar!

            <b>Variations:</b> Spicy Ketchup: Add a pinch of cayenne pepper or a 
            few dashes of hot sauce. Herb-Infused Ketchup: Stir in some finely 
            chopped 
fresh herbs like basil or thyme for a unique twist.

    <h2>Homemade Mayonnaise<h2>
    <p>
        Now, let’s move on to mayonnaise. Making mayo from scratch is 
        surprisingly easy and the result is so much better than store-bought. 
        Make sure all your ingredients are at room temperature; this helps the 
        mayonnaise emulsify properly. In a blender or food processor, combine 
        the eggs, mustard, vinegar, oil, salt, and lemon juice. Blend on medium 
        speed until the mixture is smooth, thick, and creamy. That’s it!

        The key to a perfect mayo is to add the oil very slowly. This helps the 
        mixture emulsify and turn into that creamy goodness we all love. 
        However, since we’re blending all the ingredients at once here, just 
        ensure you blend it long enough for everything to come together nicely. 
        I like to use an immersion blender and it never fails to make the most 
        creamy homemade mayo!
    
        <b>Tips and Tricks:</b> For a lighter mayo, use half vegetable oil and 
        half olive oil. If you want a tangier mayo, add a bit more lemon juice 
        or vinegar. To make a richer mayo, you can use only the egg yolks 
        instead of whole eggs.
    
        <b>Variations:</b> Garlic Mayo: Add a clove of minced garlic to the 
        blender for a garlicky kick. Herb Mayo: Blend in some fresh herbs like 
        dill, parsley, or chives for an herbaceous twist. Spicy Mayo: Add a 
        teaspoon of sriracha or hot sauce for a spicy version.

    <h2>Storage And Shelf Life<h2>
    <p>
        Homemade condiments are best stored in the refrigerator. For 
        ketchup, once it’s cooled, transfer it to a clean jar or bottle with 
        a tight-fitting lid. It will keep for up to three weeks in the 
        fridge. As for mayonnaise, store it in a clean jar as well and use 
        it within two weeks. Always make sure to use a clean spoon to scoop 
        out your condiments to avoid contamination and extend their shelf 
        life.

        Making your own condiments at home is not only fun but also allows 
        you to control the ingredients and flavors. Plus, they taste so much 
        better than store-bought versions! Give these recipes a try and 
        enjoy the delicious, fresh taste of homemade ketchup and mayo.
