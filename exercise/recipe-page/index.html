        <h2>Homemade Ketchup</h2>

            Let's start with the ketchup! Begin by combining tomato paste and 
            water in a medium saucepan. Stir until the paste is fully diluted; 
            this will form the base of your ketchup. Next, add Worcestershire 
            sauce, sugar, vinegar, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, 
            and cinnamon. Whisk everything together until smooth and 
            well-blended.
        </p>
        <p>
            Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a 
            simmer. Once it starts to bubble, reduce the heat to low and let it 
            cook for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. This simmering 
            process allows the flavors to meld together beautifully and helps 
            thicken the ketchup. Once it has thickened to your liking, remove 
            the saucepan from the heat and let the ketchup cool. Transfer it to 
            a jar or bottle and pop it in the fridge.
        </p>

            <b>Tips and Tricks:</b> For a smokier flavor, try adding a dash of 
            smoked paprika or chipotle powder. If you prefer a smoother ketchup, 
            you can blend it once it has cooled down in a food processor or 
            blender. Adjust the sweetness by adding more or less sugar according 
            to your taste. If you like it more acidic, add more vinegar!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Variations:</b> Spicy Ketchup: Add a pinch of cayenne pepper or a 
            few dashes of hot sauce. Herb-Infused Ketchup: Stir in some finely 
            chopped fresh herbs like basil or thyme for a unique twist.

        <h2>Homemade Mayonnaise</h2>
        <p>
            Making mayo from scratch is surprisingly easy and the result is so 
            much better than store-bought. Make sure all your ingredients are at 
            room temperature; this helps the mayonnaise emulsify properly.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Tips and Tricks:</b> For a lighter mayo, use half vegetable oil 
            and half olive oil. If you want a tangier mayo, add a bit more lemon 
            juice or vinegar. To make a richer mayo, you can use only the egg 
            yolks instead of whole eggs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Variations:</b> Garlic Mayo: Add a clove of minced garlic to the 
            blender for a garlicky kick. Herb Mayo: Blend in some fresh herbs 
            like dill, parsley, or chives for an herbaceous twist. Spicy Mayo: 
            Add a teaspoon of sriracha or hot sauce for a spicy version.

            Homemade condiments are best stored in the refrigerator. For 
            ketchup, once it's cooled, transfer it to a clean jar or bottle with 
            a tight-fitting lid. It will keep for up to three weeks in the 
            fridge. As for mayonnaise, store it in a clean jar as well and use 
            it within two weeks.
