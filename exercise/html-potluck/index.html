        <h2>Rise of the Rogue AI</h2>
        <p>
            When Tony Stark and Bruce Banner experiment with artificial 
            intelligence to create a global peacekeeping program, they 
            unintentionally give rise to Ultron, a self-aware AI with a warped 
            vision of <i>world peace</i> that involves humanity's extinction. 
            As Ultron amasses an army of robotic minions, the Avengers must 
            reunite to stop his apocalyptic plan. Along the way, they encounter 
            new allies and adversaries, including the superhuman twins Wanda and 
            Pietro Maximoff and the synthetic being Vision. Amidst personal 
            struggles and rising tensions within the team, the Avengers fight to 
            protect the world from destruction, setting the stage for future 
            battles against seven greater threats.

        <h2>The Mad Titan's Quest</h2>
        <p>
            As the Avengers and their allies confront the fallout from their 
            past conflicts, a cosmic threat looms: Thanos, the Mad Titan, 
            embarks on a universe-altering quest to collect all six Infinity 
            Stones. With the power to wipe out half of all life with a snap of 
            his fingers, Thanos seeks to impose his twisted version of balance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Heroes from across the galaxy—including the Guardians of the Galaxy, 
            Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, and Black Panther—join forces in a 
            desperate fight to stop him. Battles erupt on multiple fronts, from 
            the depths of space to the Wakandan plains, but even their combined 
            strength may not be enough to thwart Thanos' relentless drive. As 
            the Avengers face devastating losses and moral dilemmas, they must 
            grapple with failure and the price of heroism in the face of an 
            unstoppable force.

        <h2>The Final Reckoning</h2>
        <p>
            After Thanos' devastating snap erased half of all life in the 
            universe, the remaining Avengers are left shattered, grappling with 
            loss and failure. Five years later, a glimmer of hope emerges when 
            Scott Lang (Ant-Man) escapes the quantum realm, presenting the team 
            with a bold and dangerous plan: to travel back in time and collect 
            the Infinity Stones before Thanos can.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reuniting old allies and facing past challenges, the Avengers embark 
            on a time-heist, revisiting key moments in their history to rewrite 
            the future. As they face emotional reunions and heartbreaking 
            sacrifices, the team unites for one final battle against Thanos, who 
            returns with renewed vengeance.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a climactic showdown, the Avengers fight not only for their 
            survival but for the very fabric of the universe. With heroism, 
            loss, and triumph at its core, <i>Endgame</i> delivers a powerful 
            conclusion to the Infinity Saga, showcasing the enduring legacy of 
            Earth's mightiest heroes.
